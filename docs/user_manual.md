2. Once inside the chatbot, you'll encounter several buttons with various functions. These buttons enable actions such as closing the chatbot window, navigating back to the previous message if an incorrect option was selected, and restarting the conversation by selecting a different language.

### How to Find Resource 
- In the chat flow, the left side represents the chatbot, while the right side displays the choices you have made. Additional options are available at the bottom of the chatbot interface to further refine your search and assist in locating the specific resources you require. As you progress through a series of questions, relevant resources will be generated to address your needs.

### Want to Get Follow-up? 
1. Upon reaching the conclusion of the conversation, you'll be prompted to indicate whether you have additional questions. If you select "yes," you'll be directed to choose a category for further inquiries. Alternatively, if you choose "no," the chatbot will guide you to proceed with follow-up actions.

If you provide your email address, you'll receive a copy of the conversation for your records, along with the resources discussed.

2. Regarding the four small buttons, the first "+" enables zooming in, the second "-" facilitates zooming out, the third button shows all messages (minimizing them), and the fourth button locks the relative positions of messages. On the left sidebar, "Prompts" pertains to the current page, allowing users to add, delete, or update messages and options. "Resources" redirects to a page for managing resources, enabling users to add, delete, or update them. Similarly, "Languages" redirects to a page for language management, allowing users to add, delete, or update languages.
